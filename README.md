This repository contains the code and implementation for shapes image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and PyTorch. The project, as detailed in the accompanying Medium article (Step-by-Step: Shapes Image Classification using CNN and PyTorch), focuses on training a CNN to classify different shapes, providing step-by-step guidance through the process.

Shapes classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and this project demonstrates how to leverage PyTorch to build and train a CNN for this task. The dataset comprises images of various shapes, and the CNN is designed to learn and classify these shapes accurately. The implementation details, including the model architecture, training process, and evaluation, are thoroughly explained in the Medium article.

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1.Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/shapes-classification.git ](https://github.com/vidulavk/Shape-Classification)
                        cd shapes-classification
2.Install the required dependencies
3.Train the CNN
4.Evaluate the model

The CNN architecture is defined in the model.py file. You can customize the architecture and experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model for your specific use case.

The project provides insights into the model's performance through evaluation metrics and visualizations. The Medium article offers a detailed analysis of the results, helping users understand the model's strengths and areas for improvement.

Special thanks to the author of the Medium article (@mac.window.10) for sharing this insightful guide on shapes image classification using CNN and PyTorch.
